The course covered the basics of the interface, basic sketching techniques, and an introduction to 3D modeling. I found the lessons on creating simple sketches and transforming them into 3D models especially helpful. The tutorial was well-structured, making complex tools easy to understand, and the hands-on practice helped me gain confidence with the software. Overall, it was a great learning experience that has laid a strong foundation for further exploration of Fusion 360.",
